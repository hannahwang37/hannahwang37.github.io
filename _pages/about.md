I am Xiaohan Wang (王晓涵), a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, where I am advised by [Prof. Matthew Berger](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/?pid=matthew-berger). My research focuses on **visual analysis for neural fields**, exploring how machine learning techniques can improve visual data exploration and how visualization can enhance various aspects of machine learning.

Research Interests
======
- **Machine Learning & Visualization**: Developing novel approaches that bridge machine learning and data visualization
- **Neural Fields**: Working on visual analysis techniques for neural field representations
- **Generative Models**: Controlling generative model outputs through topological guidance
- **Interactive Systems**: Creating user-friendly interfaces for complex data exploration

Education
======
- **Ph.D. in Computer Science**, Vanderbilt University (Aug. 2023 - Expected May 2028)
- **B.Eng. in Software Engineering**, Nanjing Normal University (Sep. 2019 - Jun. 2023)

Current Research
======
I am currently working on **feature-driven parameter space exploration of simulation ensembles**, where I develop bidirectional latent spaces that bridge simulation parameters and outputs, enabling real-time inverse design from user-specified features. This work leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) for highly compressed yet accurate field representations and supports multi-scale feature analysis.

Prior to my current work, I developed **TopologyGuidance**, a novel method to control diffusion model outputs using vector field topology. This research proved particularly effective on 2D vector fields in fluid dynamics simulations, accurately maintaining critical points and enabling enhanced ensemble analysis.
