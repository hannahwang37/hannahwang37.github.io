Research Projects
======
* **Feature-driven parameter space exploration of simulation ensembles** (Apr. 2024 - Present)
  * **Inverse Mapping via Latent-Space Learning**: Developed a bidirectional latent space bridging simulation parameters and outputs, enabling real-time inverse design from user-specified features while maintaining low dimensionality proportional to parameter count.
  * **Flexible Feature Extraction with Implicit Neural Representations**: Leveraged INRs to achieve highly compressed yet accurate field representations, multi-scale feature support, and derivative-based feature computation.
  * **Interactive Interface**: Developed an interactive interface supporting multiple interactions with different large-scale simulation ensembles.

* **TopologyGuidance: Controlling the Outputs of Generative Models via Vector Field Topology** (Sep. 2023 - Mar. 2024)
  * **Topology Guidance for DDPM**: Innovated a method to control diffusion model outputs to align with specified topological features using a coordinate-based neural network.
  * **Enhanced Controllability**: Improved generative model precision by guiding the denoising process based on topological signals.
  * **Validation**: Proved method effectiveness on 2D vector fields in fluid flows, accurately maintaining critical points.

* **EmotionLens: Interactive Visual Exploration of the Circumplex Emotion Space** (Nov. 2022 - Mar. 2023)
  * Created a new emotion dataset including literary works from different time periods, genres, and languages.
  * Designed an interactive system enabling users to analyze literary emotions at different levels and perspectives.
  * Introduced an enhanced affective word cloud adjusting word weight, position, and color.

* **BallonVis: Hybrid Line-Based and Region-Based Interactive Set Data Visualization Tool** (Oct. 2020 â€“ Feb. 2021)
  * Designed a Balloon Connection Method based on the item connection blob algorithm.
  * Combined control points to bypass obstacles while connecting data items by lines.
  * Designed energy optimization-based routing algorithm and spring force algorithm.
