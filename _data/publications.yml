  - title: "Who's Pushing the Code? An Exploration of GitHub Impersonation"
    authors: "Yueke Zhang, Anda Liang, Xiaohan Wang, Jiaxin Song, Ming Zhong, and Bradley Reaves"
    venue: "IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)"
    year: 2025
    description: "This research investigates the phenomenon of GitHub impersonation and its potential impacts on software security and authenticity. The study examines various methods through which malicious actors can impersonate legitimate developers on GitHub, analyzes the prevalence of such activities, and discusses the implications for the software development ecosystem. This paper presents the first empirical study of GitHub impersonation risks. Through interviews with 17 OSS contributors, we revealed widespread underestimation of threats, while analysis of 12.5M commits exposed critical vulnerabilities in current systems."

  - title: "EmotionLens: Interactive visual exploration of the circumplex emotion space in literary works via affective word clouds"
    authors: "Bingyuan Wang, Qing Shi, Xiaohan Wang, You Zhou, Wei Zeng, and Zeyu Wang"
    venue: "Visual Informatics"
    year: 2025
    description: "This paper presents EmotionLens, an interactive system for visual exploration of emotions in literary works. The work introduces a new emotion dataset including literary works from different time periods, genres, and languages, with detailed valence and arousal labels. The system enables users to analyze literary emotions at different levels (individual, group, society) and from different perspectives (distribution, timeline, correlation) through an enhanced affective word cloud that adjusts word weight, position, and color to make emotional analysis of literary texts more intuitive and insightful."
