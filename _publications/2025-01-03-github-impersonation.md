This paper presents the first empirical study of GitHub impersonation risks. Through interviews with 17 OSS contributors, we revealed widespread underestimation of threats, while analysis of 12.5M commits exposed critical vulnerabilities in current systems. The study found that existing safeguards like commit signing are ineffective, with platform logs failing to distinguish impersonation from legitimate pull requests, exposing fundamental detection gaps in the current ecosystem.
