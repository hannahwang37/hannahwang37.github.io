This paper introduces a novel method to control diffusion model outputs to align with specified topological features using a coordinate-based neural network. The approach enhances the controllability of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) by guiding the denoising process based on topological signals, ensuring accurate field generation. The method's effectiveness was validated on 2D vector fields in fluid dynamics simulations, accurately maintaining critical points and enabling enhanced ensemble analysis.
