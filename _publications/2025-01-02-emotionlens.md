This paper presents EmotionLens, an interactive system for visual exploration of emotions in literary works. The work introduces a new emotion dataset including literary works from different time periods, genres, and languages, with detailed valence and arousal labels. The system enables users to analyze literary emotions at different levels (individual, group, society) and from different perspectives (distribution, timeline, correlation) through an enhanced affective word cloud that adjusts word weight, position, and color to make emotional analysis of literary texts more intuitive and insightful.
