This paper introduces BallonVis, a hybrid approach for set data visualization that combines line-based and region-based techniques. The work features a Balloon Connection Method based on the item connection blob algorithm, using control points to bypass obstacles while connecting data items by lines, with energy optimization-based routing and spring force algorithms to maintain natural and intuitive connections.
